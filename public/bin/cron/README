This is a simple cron setup written in bash. It may be a good start if you don't
want too much dependencies.

It can be used to run individual binaries or directories. For directories, all
executables within the directory tree is executed. Timeouts are supported.
See run_cron comments for more information. Run example.run for an example.

If you have more sophisticated needs, you may want to have a look at Zeus which
has heavier dependencies (uses Room77 python libraries etc.).
