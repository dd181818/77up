File and file io related utility libraries. Some are pretty old and they are not
portable. A linux variant is assumed. Known to work with GCC. May or may not
work with other compilers. If you need to use code that depends on these on
other platforms, you may need to implement a subset of the APIs yourself.

APIs are old and not on par with current Room77 practices. Some could have been
implemented in a better way as well. Some of the libraries / tests we would like
to open source use a subset of the functionality defined here.
