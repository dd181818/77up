This directory contains various networking related libraries such as basic http
https clients, http server and example rpc client / server code.

A good deal of the code is pretty old. Style is not pn par with our latest
practices and we know that some portions can be implemented more efficiently.
Some portions of the code is relatively new and good quality (methods API).

This is one of the components we deemed useful enough that you may either use it
as is or as a starting point rather than starting from scratch.
We do not consider this portion highest quality.

NOTE: RPC server / client and util libraries have missing dependencies on basic
internal libraries we do not find generic / high quality enough to open source.
For now, they are provided as examples on how one may use the lower level
libraries.

See various tests under the tests directory for example usage.
