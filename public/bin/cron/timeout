[ -z "$1" ] && echo "Usage: `basename $0` TIMEOUT COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]

Runs COMMAND with ARGUMENTS with specified TIMEOUT value.
If timeout is reached, command and its children are killed.

Following timeout suffixes can be specified for convenience.
    s     seconds. Same as no suffix.
    m     minutes. (e.g. 6m = 6 * 60 seconds).
    h     hours (e.g. 3h for 3 hours).
    d     days

Note that the timeout field is not validated and assumes that only one suffix
is supplied. So please verify the timeout values you supply.

This script will automatically be used by run_cron.
