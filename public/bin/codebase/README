Quick and dirty utility scripts useful for maintaining codebases.
Pretty handy for fixing patterns during refactoring / moving things around.

You would want to call them from a suitable depth (subdirectories should not be
too large). Top level is probably fine for small codebases.

search: Search for string in subdirs.
    e.g. search "class Foo {"

replace: search and replace occurence of first pattern with second pattern.
    e.g. replace "class Foo {" "class Bar {"

fix_include_guards: recursively search for .h files. Check and potentially
    fix #ifndef FOO #define FOO #endif type include guards.
