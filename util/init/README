Initialization / Finalization framework used in Room77 codebase.
You can register init and exit hooks (lamda functions) with assigned groups and
priorities.

Instead of using your own main, you define init_main instead (defined in main.cc
here). init hooks are called in parallel in priority order right before main.
exit hooks are called in parallel in priority order right before main exits.

You can enable / disable some of the groups via commandline parameters (e.g. to
skip expensive initializations you don't need for debugging your current work).

Most of Room77 intializations are designed in a way that they are lazy and
loaded on demand in a thread safe way as needed. For production use, we use the
init mechanisms to trigger the lazy initializations to prep the servers.
