This directory contains various networking related libraries such as basic http
https clients, http server and rpc client and server implementations.

A good deal of the code is pretty old. Style is not pn par with our latest
practices and we know that some portions can be implemented more efficiently.
We also have a few cleanups in mind that we did not get around to do yet.
Some portions of the code is relatively new and good quality (methods API).
Most of our internal code use the high level methods API and does not even refer
to the lower level libraries.

This is one of the components we deemed useful enough that you may either use it
as is or as a starting point rather than starting from scratch.
We do not consider this portion highest quality.

There are one or two missing dependencies for some targets. We will get to them
in time. Most of the basic targets should compile (except servers).

See various tests for example usage.
