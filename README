Various core libraries and utilities open sourced by Room77.

This directory contains open sourced code. Some of the code is copyrighted by
Optrip Inc., some by Room77 Inc., and some by individual authors.
Some of the code are copyrighted by a mixture of the above as well.

Irrespective of the copyright owner, if the code is published within this
directory, the intention is to publish it under a permissive MIT or BSD like
open source license.

You can use, modify, redistribute the software here as you see fit. The software
is made available as is without any guarantees or warranties. Room77 or authors
are not responsible for any damages you may incur as a result of using this code
or a subset of it. It is your responsibility to check the code for correctness
before use.

The software is shared with the hopes that it will be useful to others. If you
find any bugs or made improvements or if you just want to let us know that it
was useful to you, we would love to hear from you.

You would need a recent compiler with decent C++11 support (e.g. gcc 4.8,
clang 3.5). Most code should work with gcc. Some are tested with clang as well.

Some of the libraries / components are fairly independent and can easily be
compiled or added to other codebases. Some of the components have more
dependencies that are not trivial to decouple. We tried to streamline the
dependencies for most useful components when practical.

Some of the code depend on external libraries (e.g. icu, leveldb, gunit etc.).
In order to compile and use them, you would need to install the appropriate
libraries yourself. We tried to minimize dependency on such libraries when
practical.

A good portion of the tests use googletest / googlemock which are not included
as part of this package. We added convenience scripts under third_party/google/*
you can use to fetch and install them if you desire. Some of the tests and a
small subset of libraries will not compile without them.

Internally we use our own flash build system to build packages. We intent to
open source this tool as well, but it will take time to remove internal
dependencies and generalize it. RULES files you may see in various directories
are used within flash and they are fairly intuitive. It should be relatively
straightforward to see the dependencies and translate the RULES entries manually
to your own favorite build systems for the libraries you care about. RULES files
are provided as examples for now.

We included a simple script (bin/build_and_run) to compile and run example
targets. You may see test scripts throughout the codebase that symlink to or
call this script. (e.g. util/factory/factory_test).

The quality of the code from our perspective varies from fine to good to great.
Some of the code is using brand new C++11 features with arguably better APIs.
Some of the code is fairly old with older style and practices. If we were to
write them from scratch today with enough time in our hands, end results may
probably look quite different for some. For some, we are fairly happy with.

While choosing what to include in this package, we generally asked ourselves the
following questions:

- Is the component potentially useful to others?
- Is the component high enough quality? Would potential users rather modify them
  to suit their needs or start from scratch?
- Is the component fairly independent?
- Do we have enough time / man power to clean it up and make it available?

This is a work in progress. If you have any comments or feedback, please let
us know. We are open to receiving improvements and patches as well but we need
to weigh general usefulness and complexity of integration as most of the
components are heavily used withinf our own codebase. This is not a fork.
