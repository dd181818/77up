This directory contains libraries and utilities used in Room77 from Bilgehan
Uygar Oztekin's personal libraries. The reason they are here is because the
intended license for these components may not necessarily be as permissive as
the MIT license used in other Room77 open sourced code.

Uygar retains the option to open source the components here with a more
restrictive license (e.g. GPLv3).
